## üìå**Introduction**

Laptops vary significantly in price depending on their specifications, such as processor generation, RAM, and storage capacity. This project provides an exploratory analysis of the dataset used for laptop price prediction and recommendation. Various plots and visualizations are created to uncover relationships and trends within the data.

## üéØ **Features**

- **Correlation Analysis**: Heatmap showing feature correlations with price.
- **Scatter Plots**: Relationships between key features (e.g., RAM, Processor Gen, Price).
- **Box Plots**: Distribution of prices across brands and other categories.
- **Distribution Analysis**: Histogram and KDE plots for price distributions.
- **KNN Classification Visualization**: Scatter plots showing KNN classification results.
- **Residual Plot**: Evaluating the model's prediction errors.
- **Feature Importance**: Visualizing the contribution of features in model predictions.

# üìä Results
- **Price vs. RAM:** A positive correlation is observed; higher RAM often leads to higher prices.
- **Price vs. Processor Generation:** Newer generations significantly increase laptop prices.
- **Brand vs. Price:** Box plots reveal that premium brands like Apple have higher median prices compared to others.
- **Feature Correlation:** A heatmap shows strong relationships between Price, Processor_gen, and RAM_GB.
- **KNN Results:** Scatter plots visualize how the model classifies brands based on laptop specs.
