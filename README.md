## **Introduction**
Laptop prices vary based on technical specifications such as processor type, RAM, storage, and GPU. This project aims to:
- Predict laptop prices based on their specifications.
- Recommend laptops within a user-defined budget.

The project leverages machine learning models to predict prices and offers insights into the relationship between hardware specifications and costs.

---

## **Features**
- Import and utilize essential Python libraries.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for better model performance.
- Implementation of machine learning models for price prediction.
- Recommendation system for budget-friendly laptops based on user preferences.
- Model evaluation and visualization of results.

---

## **Technologies Used**
1. **Python**: Core programming language.
2. **Pandas, NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
3. **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For data visualization.
4. **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and evaluation.
5. **Google Colaboratory**: For executing the notebook seamlessly.

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains various laptop specifications and corresponding prices. Key features include:
- `Processor_name,processor_gen`: Type of processor (e.g., Intel Core i5, AMD Ryzen 5).
- `RAM`: Size of RAM in GB.
- `Storage`: Type and size of storage (e.g., 256GB SSD, 1TB HDD).
- `Brand`: Brand name of the laptop.

The dataset is included:
- Dataset files into a `data/` folder:
  - `laptop_price_recommendation_cleaned_dataset.csv`: Original dataset.
  - `input_features.csv,output_features.csv`: Cleaned dataset after preprocessing.

## **Setup and Installation**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/laptop-price-recommendation.git
   cd laptop-price-recommendation
  

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   

3. Open the project in Google Colaboratory or Jupyter Notebook:
 ```
   jupyter notebook notebooks/laptop_price_prediction.ipynb

 ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook /Google colob file located in the `notebooks/` directory.
2. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to:
   - Preprocess the dataset.
   - Train and evaluate machine learning models.
   - Use the recommendation system to find budget-friendly laptops.
3. Modify hyperparameters or dataset values within the notebook to explore different scenarios.

## **Results**
- The trained machine learning models successfully predicted laptop prices with high accuracy.
- The following algorithms were used, and their evaluation metrics are as follows:
  - Linear Regression: RÂ² = 0.85
- The recommendation system provided accurate suggestions for budget-friendly laptops based on user preferences.

## **Limitations**
- The dataset may not include the latest laptop models, which could affect the relevance of the predictions.
- The recommendation system is primarily based on budget and does not incorporate additional user preferences such as operating system, battery life, or design,etc,.
- Model performance is dependent on the quality and diversity of the dataset. A more diverse dataset may yield better results.
- The system currently works offline and lacks integration with live e-commerce data.
- Some times the encoding and decoding encounders miss matching data between original and predicted.
